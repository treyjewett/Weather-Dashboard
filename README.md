# Weather-Dashboard

A quick weather app using OpenWeather API.

## The Project

Everyone has the occasional need to check the weather. Between planning days to eat out or if a morning run will be runed by rain, a decent weather app always has a purpose. This application is desigend to deliver a brief overview of the weather for the current day and a very brief look at the weather for the next 5 days. Simply search by the city of interest and the results will load from there. Preveious searches can also be accessed as they are saved under the search bar each time you add a new city!

## Code Utilized

This project was constructed using HTML, Bootstrap, CSS, and jQuery.

## What to Expect

When the Weather Dashboard is loaded:
- A simple page with the title "Weather Dashboard" is displayed with a search bar titled "Search for a City" on the left-hand side.
- Once a city is typed in, and the user presses the search icon, weather data is displayed for the user to view.
- The weather data is divided into two sections: current weather and a 5 day forecast.
- The current weather is larger and catches the eye of the user.
- Underneath the current weather, a 5 day forecast is presented to aid the user if they need to plan ahead.
- When the search button is pressed, the city is added underneath the label "Previous Cities Searched" as a button.
- If a previous search button is pressed, the weather and forecast for that button is loaded.

## Lessons Learned

This was a great learning experience. Getting to know how APIs work and how to decipher their documentation was something completely different and a useful tool to utilize in future projects!
